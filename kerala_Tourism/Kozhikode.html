            Kozhikode, also known as Calicut, is a district with a rich historical legacy as it was where Vasco da Gama
            first landed in India in 1498, opening the European spice trade route. This coastal district is known for
            its
            warm hospitality and is often referred to as the "City of Spices." The district is famous for its culinary
            delights, particularly the Malabar biryani and Kozhikode halwa (a sweet delicacy). The bustling S.M. Street
            (Sweet Meat Street) is a paradise for shoppers and food lovers, offering a wide range of traditional items
            and
            local specialties. Kozhikode Beach, with its old lighthouse and two piers extending into the sea, is a
            popular
            spot for watching stunning sunsets. The district is also home to Thusharagiri Falls, a scenic cascade
            surrounded
            by lush greenery and offering opportunities for trekking. The district has a rich cultural heritage and is
            known
            for its contributions to Malayalam literature and arts. The Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics,
            which
            flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries, was based in this region and made significant contributions
            to
            mathematics. With its blend of historical significance, cultural richness, culinary excellence, and natural
            beauty, Kozhikode offers visitors a multi-faceted experience that showcases the essence of Kerala's coastal
            charm and heritage.
